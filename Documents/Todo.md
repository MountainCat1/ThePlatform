## Map Generation

Create basic map generation based on a seed. After each level there should be more rooms
The amount of rooms should just depend on the level player is on.

Rooms should be connected with corridors, if this will prove itself too hard, 
just make them one next to the other.

### Rooms
* Cafeteria - more enemies, diverse but scarce loot 
* Armory - random guns, metal, and a lot of more powerful enemies
* Storage - a lot of metal an electronics
* Laboratory - _wierd_ enemies, and chemicals
* Office - a lot of weaker enemies, diverse loot
* Just a room - just a room
* Server room - electronics and some metal

**There needs to be more! That's should be just a start. On later levels there should
appear new much cooler rooms!**

## Enemies 

Enemies should depend on a level

### Tier 1
* Rat
* Hacked cleaning robot
* Zombie
* Rebel

### Tier 2
* Mutated rat
* Defense system robot
* Zombie in armor
* Armored Rebel

**There need to be more tiers, that's just a start!**
